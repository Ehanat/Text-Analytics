I just bought the Onegame gaming chair with rest adjustment function, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. As someone who is 6 feet tall it has been hard for me to finally a comfortable and tall gaming chair, putting the chair together was a piece of cake, instructions were very easy to understand and follow. The most important thing is how comfortable the chair is for my long hours of desk work, and the cushions are the best things my old chairs never had.

This is a very solid option for affordable gaming chairs. Most gaming chairs are much more expensive than they should be just because of the ""gaming"" branding - and most gamers would be better served by an office chair for the same amount of money. This gaming chair hits a nice sweet spot where it's not any more expensive than the average office chair, but it still has the ""cool"" looks of a gaming chair.I didn't bother adding any photos as the existing ones tell the story just fine. It looks as advertised, and I think it looks pretty cool.The support is fine, pretty standard for a computer chair that isn't in the thousands of dollars. I find it pretty comfortable for decent stretches of time - only dwarfed in comparison to the 1-2 thousand dollar chairs I see in the office.My biggest complaint with this thing was the assembly. It has a ton of separate parts that you have to put together, and while it's not particular difficult, the instructions could definitely be better - and it could require less assembly. I've ordered chairs online before that came in 3-4 pieces and were much quicker and easier to put together than this one, and I'm docking a star primarily for that reason.

My son really likes his new gaming chair.  The white and black PU leather blended colors make the gaming chair very cool and stylish.  The installation of the chair is also fairly easy and quick, and only took me about 15 minutes to put together.  In addition, the adjustable lumbar supporting pillow and the neck supporting pillows are great to have for gaming chair at this price range.  The arm rest is also adjustable to be raised or lowered.  I would recommend this gaming chair, specially for teenagers, it’s such a nice and stylish gaming chair to have.

My rating is for the instructions that are horrible to follow. I had to go to YouTube and find someone who had something similar to help putting this together. Save yourself the headache and get you some new wheels; the ones that came with it are not the best. The chair is a nice looking chair. I got it for office desk and not for gaming. The seat bottom is a little hard, but I just got it so it may get better.

The chair is very comfortable. I especially like that the lumbar support is just right. I now sit in this chair every night to watch movies.

I think looks and functionality it's a 10/10.  The seat adjusts up/down forward/back and the seat back goes down to almost a laying position.  The arm rests adjust up and down and the included pillows for lumber and head/neck support are easy to put on and off.  The only thing I don't like is that there's not much padding on the wing sides of the seat and overall it's a little stiffer than I was expecting.  It's not to the level that it makes or brakes it, but I haven't spent more than an hour or so gaming in it yet.Assembly was pretty straight forward, but most chairs I've bought already have the seat and the back assembled.  This one you have to put everything together so it does pack tighter for shipping, but it's just more time consuming.Overall this is a great chair with a cool look and the price is in line with similar chairs.

First of all, for this price, no way you are getting this quality looks and comfortable feeling chair, I can assure you that as a gamer and engineer who spends half the day in office/gaming chair or some sort of chair.-Looks great, it looks and feels like a sparco racing seat,-Works perfect, easy to install and move around,-Very very comfortable, it is on point, very firm memory foam,-Breathing faux leather prevents overheating on the body, so no sweat!-It isn't small, many affordable chairs looks decent size in pictures, but when you buy it it is much smaller, this isn't the case here. This is a large chair, i am 6ft tall and back goes above my head, lower bottom also isn't hitting back of knees, nor even close so perfectly designed and sized chair!-Side support both on back and on bottom part is greatly thought and placed.-Adjusting arms, tilting whole seat, up and down raise n drop as well as adjusting stiffness and additionally height and location adjustable neck pillow and lumbar support, for this price is awesome.-Chair Legs got nice coverage but they are also not excessively wide, you can lay the back all the way down, turn it into a dentist chair, lay on it and flip around, it will not tip over!-It does lay 180 degree flat, no grinding, no clicking, crackling or any other weird noises or issues with it.most affordable chairs don't even lean back 150 degrees, this is amazing.I have been using it so far 2 days in, the main question and really deciding point on this would be the longevity and how it handles moderate abuse from daily use.I will update my review at some point, but poking around, forcing edges and corners, i have a feeling that this chair will last 5years easy in my opinion. Either way, it is most definitely worth every single penny. Co-workers who saw this, they are planning to buy as well.Whoever made and designed this, well done!

My rating is for the instructions that are horrible to follow. I had to go to YouTube and find someone who had something similar to help putting this together. Save yourself the headache and get you some new wheels; the ones that came with it are not the best. The chair is a nice looking chair. I got it for office desk and not for gaming. The seat bottom is a little hard, but I just got it so it may get better.

I think looks and functionality it's a 10/10.  The seat adjusts up/down forward/back and the seat back goes down to almost a laying position.  The arm rests adjust up and down and the included pillows for lumber and head/neck support are easy to put on and off.  The only thing I don't like is that there's not much padding on the wing sides of the seat and overall it's a little stiffer than I was expecting.  It's not to the level that it makes or brakes it, but I haven't spent more than an hour or so gaming in it yet.Assembly was pretty straight forward, but most chairs I've bought already have the seat and the back assembled.  This one you have to put everything together so it does pack tighter for shipping, but it's just more time consuming.Overall this is a great chair with a cool look and the price is in line with similar chairs.

First of all, for this price, no way you are getting this quality looks and comfortable feeling chair, I can assure you that as a gamer and engineer who spends half the day in office/gaming chair or some sort of chair.-Looks great, it looks and feels like a sparco racing seat,-Works perfect, easy to install and move around,-Very very comfortable, it is on point, very firm memory foam,-Breathing faux leather prevents overheating on the body, so no sweat!-It isn't small, many affordable chairs looks decent size in pictures, but when you buy it it is much smaller, this isn't the case here. This is a large chair, i am 6ft tall and back goes above my head, lower bottom also isn't hitting back of knees, nor even close so perfectly designed and sized chair!-Side support both on back and on bottom part is greatly thought and placed.-Adjusting arms, tilting whole seat, up and down raise n drop as well as adjusting stiffness and additionally height and location adjustable neck pillow and lumbar support, for this price is awesome.-Chair Legs got nice coverage but they are also not excessively wide, you can lay the back all the way down, turn it into a dentist chair, lay on it and flip around, it will not tip over!-It does lay 180 degree flat, no grinding, no clicking, crackling or any other weird noises or issues with it.most affordable chairs don't even lean back 150 degrees, this is amazing.I have been using it so far 2 days in, the main question and really deciding point on this would be the longevity and how it handles moderate abuse from daily use.I will update my review at some point, but poking around, forcing edges and corners, i have a feeling that this chair will last 5years easy in my opinion.

I just bought the Onegame gaming chair with rest adjustment function, and I have to say that I am very happy with it. As someone who is 6 feet tall it has been hard for me to finally a comfortable and tall gaming chair, putting the chair together was a piece of cake, instructions were very easy to understand and follow. The most important thing is how comfortable the chair is for my long hours of desk work, and the cushions are the best things my old chairs never had.

This is a very solid option for affordable gaming chairs. Most gaming chairs are much more expensive than they should be just because of the ""gaming"" branding - and most gamers would be better served by an office chair for the same amount of money. This gaming chair hits a nice sweet spot where it's not any more expensive than the average office chair, but it still has the ""cool"" looks of a gaming chair.I didn't bother adding any photos as the existing ones tell the story just fine. It looks as advertised, and I think it looks pretty cool.The support is fine, pretty standard for a computer chair that isn't in the thousands of dollars. I find it pretty comfortable for decent stretches of time - only dwarfed in comparison to the 1-2 thousand dollar chairs I see in the office.My biggest complaint with this thing was the assembly. It has a ton of separate parts that you have to put together, and while it's not particular difficult, the instructions could definitely be better - and it could require less assembly. I've ordered chairs online before that came in 3-4 pieces and were much quicker and easier to put together than this one, and I'm docking a star primarily for that reason.

The installation of the chair is also fairly easy and quick, and only took me about 15 minutes to put together.
